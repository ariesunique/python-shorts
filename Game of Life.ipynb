    "\n",
    "### The rules\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the rules (*from Wikipedia*):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n",
    "Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n",
    "All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n",
    "The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[top](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The above logic can be simplified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily concerned with cells that will change state: \n",
    "* a cell that is ALIVE can become DEAD  \n",
    "* a cell that is DEAD can become ALIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the conditions that cause a cell to change state?\n",
    "* A cell that is ALIVE becomes DEAD if it has less than 2 live neighbors or more than 3 live neighbors.\n",
    "* A cell that is DEAD becomes ALIVE if it has exactly 3 LIVE neighbors\n",

    "\n",

An optional CELL paramter can be provided which represents the starting cell (default is (1,1), ie the first cell in the upper-left corner of the board). Beginning with a given cell, the code will move to the right as far as possible, then move to the first cell in the column below the current cell. So cells will be returned from right to left, top to bottom (the same order that we read English). This method continues until it reaches the last cell in the grid.\n",
