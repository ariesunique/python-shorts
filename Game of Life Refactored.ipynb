    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a refactored version of [an earlier attempt](https://github.com/ariesunique/python-shorts/blob/master/Game%20of%20Life.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between this version and the earlier one is that I removed several of the helper functions. Although readability was my primary goal, my colleagues correctly pointed out that too many helper functions can also impede readability as it obscures the actual functionality of the code. The biggest change is that I removed a lot of the ugly repetition in the get_neighbors function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The above logic can be simplified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily concerned with cells that will change state: \n",
    "* a cell that is ALIVE can become DEAD  \n",
    "* a cell that is DEAD can become ALIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the conditions that cause a cell to change state?\n",
    "* A cell that is ALIVE becomes DEAD if it has less than 2 live neighbors or more than 3 live neighbors.\n",
    "* A cell that is DEAD becomes ALIVE if it has exactly 3 LIVE neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a grid\n",
    "\n",
    "We will maintain state in an n x n matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an n x n array, our indices will go from 1 .. n, with (1,1) being the cell in the top-left corner and (n,n) being the cell in the bottom-right corner\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    (1,1)   (1,2)  ...  (1,n)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (2,1)   (2,2)  ...  (2,n)\n",
    "    \n",
    "      |       |            |\n",
    "      \n",
    "    (n,1)   (n,2)  ...  (n, n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular cell in the matrix can have one of two states: ON (aka ALIVE) or OFF (aka DEAD). These can be represented as any constants of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create some helper methods to manage our game board.\n",
    "\n",
    "**__init__**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For convenience, there will be several ways to initialize a board. \n",
    "* If you provide the SIZE, you will get an n x n array (where n=SIZE) with all the cells initialized to the DEAD state.\n",
    "* You can provide INIT, which is an n x n array, representing the exact initial state of the game\n",
    "* Either SIZE or INIT must be provided for initialization.\n",
    "* User cnn also optionally specify a list of COORDS representing the cells that should be turned on (ie, set the state of the cells specified in COORDS to ALIVE). \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**get_neighbors**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will return a list of neighbors for a given cell. If the LIVEONLY flag is set, this method will include only neighbors that have a current state of ALIVE. (LIVEONLY is False by default, meaning you get the full list of neighbors if that flag is not specified).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**walk**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a generator that provides a convenient way to iterate over all the cells in the board. An optional CELL paramter can be provided which represents the starting cell (default is (1,1), ie the first cell in the upper-left corner of the board). Beginning with a given cell, the code will move to the right as far as possible, then move to the first cell in the column below the current cell. So cells will be returned from right to left, top to bottom (the same order that we read English). This method continues until it reaches the last cell in the grid.\n",
